## Description

HBNB is a web application clone of AirBnB composed by:
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
